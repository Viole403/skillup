# Security Policy

**Security Overview**

As a personal project, **skillup** prioritizes the security and integrity of its users' data, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its systems and services.

**Security Principles**

1. **Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple layers of security controls to protect against various types of attacks.
2. **Least Privilege**: Grant access and privileges only as necessary to perform a task or function.
3. **Secure by Design**: Incorporate security into the design and development of systems and services from the outset.
4. **Default Deny**: Deny access by default and only allow access as explicitly granted.
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Continuously monitor systems and services for security breaches and vulnerabilities.

**Security Practices**

1. **Secure Coding**: Follow secure coding practices to prevent common web application vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
2. **Input Validation**: Validate all user input to prevent malicious data from entering the system.
3. **Error Handling**: Handle errors in a way that does not reveal sensitive information to users.
4. **Encryption**: Use encryption to protect sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
5. **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control to ensure that users only have access to the resources they need to perform their tasks.
6. **Password Management**: Implement secure password management practices, including password hashing and salting.
7. **Regular Updates**: Regularly update systems and services to ensure any known vulnerabilities are patched.
8. **Incident Response**: Have an incident response plan in place to quickly respond to security incidents.
